# 🐍 Pi Snake Game with 16x2 LCD 

Hi guys, I'm currently working on a **Snake Game** built with the use of **Raspberry Pi4**, **16x2 LCD Screen** and some **Jumper Wires**.
You should be able to control the game with your **keyboard** to have the real experience.

## 🎮 Game Details

Just some regular snake game style we do play on **Nokia 3310** hahhaaa, you should be able control the movement of a snake using the arrow keys on a keyboard. The snake grows when it eats the food, and the game wraps around the edges of the 16x2 LCD screen. The goal is to grow the longest snake possible.
